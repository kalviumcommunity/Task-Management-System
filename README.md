# Personal Task Management Tool
**DBMS and OOP Project by Ahamed Meyan**

## About
The Personal Task Management Tool is a project designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks. It combines a well-structured database management system (DBMS) schema with the potential for an object-oriented programming (OOP) application layer to create a user-friendly task management solution.

## Project Overview
The Personal Task Management Tool offers a versatile platform for organizing tasks effectively. Users can create tasks, track their progress, set due dates, specify priorities, and archive completed tasks. The schema's design ensures data integrity and minimizes redundancy, serving as a solid foundation for task management applications.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Secure user login with hashed and salted passwords.
- **Task Creation:** Users can create tasks with detailed descriptions.
- **Task Status Tracking:** Monitor task status (e.g., "In Progress," "Completed").
- **Due Dates:** Set due dates to prioritize tasks and meet deadlines.
- **Task Prioritization:** Indicate task priority levels (e.g., "Low," "Medium," "High").
- **Task Archiving:** Archive completed tasks for better organization.
